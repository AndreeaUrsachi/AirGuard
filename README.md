AirGuard üåçüì±
AirGuard is my final year project ‚Äî a Kotlin-based Android app that monitors air quality in real-time using a physical sensor.
It communicates with a Python backend (Flask API) running Machine Learning models like Random Forest to predict air quality trends in the near future.

Key technologies:

Kotlin (Android)

Python (Flask, scikit-learn, pandas)

Machine Learning (Random Forest)

Firebase for data storage and authentication

Integration with physical air quality sensors

This project uses two main datasets for training and analysis:

The first dataset is from the World Health Organization (WHO), containing air quality data from 2024 across multiple regions and cities, providing a solid historical baseline for the models.
Link: https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/air-pollution/who-air-quality-database

The second dataset consists of real-time sensor data collected and processed by me, used to fine-tune predictions and provide up-to-date air quality insights.

Together, these datasets enable the ML models to deliver accurate and personalized forecasts for air pollution levels.
